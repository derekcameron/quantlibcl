= Introduction =

This project explores methods to offload certain quantitative finance computations to a GPU.

= Project details =

The project's main goals are as follows:
  * Identify algorithms currently in use in QuantLib which can be effectively offloaded to a modern GPU.
  * Port existing algorithms to a GPU platform.
  * Evaluate performance of original and GPU implementations.
  * Evaluate stability and accuracy of original and GPU implementations.
  * Evaluate the suitability of single-precision vs. double-precision computation.
  * Compare compute performance on various GPU platforms

While actual performance gains have not yet been determined, the goal of this project is to realize a minimum 100x increase in computation speed while preserving the stability and accuracy of the original algorithms.
